abstract = {User materials (UMAT) in finite element codes allow the researchers or engineers to apply their own material routines. Simple software interfaces are specified to represent the material behavior in software. In order to use these already existing and often validated models to Peridynamics a UMAT interface is presented. It allows the simplified use of already existing material routines in the peridynamic framework Peridigm. The interface is based on the Abaqus UMAT definition and allows the integration of Fortran routines directly into Peridigm. The integration of already existing UMAT routines based in Peridigm eliminates the need for redevelopment and reprogramming material models from classical continuum mechanics theory. In addition, the same material model implementations are applicable in finite element as well as peridynamic simulations. This opens up new possibilities for analysis, verification and comparison. With this interface many material routines can be reused and applied to progressive failure analysis. The source code is stored in a GitHub repository.}

abstract={Peridigm is a meshfree peridynamics code written in C++ for use on large-scale parallel computers. It was originally developed at Sandia National Laboratories and is currently managed as an open-source, community driven software project. Its primary features include bond-based, state-based, and non-ordinary state-based constitutive models, bond failure laws, contact, and support for explicit and implicit time integration. To date, Peridigm has been used primarily by methods developers focused on solid mechanics and material failure. Peridigm utilizes foundational software components from Sandia's Trilinos project and was designed for extensibility. This paper provides an overview of the solution methods implemented in Peridigm, a discussion of its software infrastructure, and demonstrates the use of Peridigm for the solution of several example problems.},
