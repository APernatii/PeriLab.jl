- üî® **Damage models**: Damage models such as critical stretch or an energy based criterium are included to simulate different types of damage, such as crack propagation or delamination, in their peridynamic simulations.

- üî• **Additive Manufacturing**: PeriLab supports additive manufacturing, allowing users to create custom additive models for their simulations.

- ‚ö° **MPI**: PeriLab supports parallel computing using Message Passing Interface (MPI) technology to improve simulation performance on high-performance clusters.

- üíª **HPC capabilities**: PeriLab is designed for high-performance computing (HPC) environments, allowing users to run large-scale simulations efficiently.

- üì§üì• **Exodus Input/Output**: PeriLab uses the Exodus II data format for input and output, enabling easy transfer of data between simulation tools.

- üßÆ **Abaqus Input**: PeriLab supports Abaqus input files, allowing users to create custom Abaqus models for their simulations.

- ‚ûó **Bond filter**: The bond filter feature allows users to apply specific conditions to the bonds between particles in a simulation, influencing their behavior and interaction with other particles.

- üîß **User specified Input/Output**: PeriLab provides flexible options for users to specify custom input and output files, enabling easy data manipulation and analysis.

- üß™ **Test Pipeline**: The PeriLab Source Code will be tested in a test pipeline to ensure its correctness and performance.

## Installation

The `PeriLab`  package is available through the Julia package system and can be installed using the following commands:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("PeriLab")
```

Throughout the rest of this tutorial, we will assume that you have installed the
PeriLab package and have already typed `using PeriLab` to bring all of the
relevant variables into your current namespace.

## Getting Started with `PeriLab` 

Jumpstart your exploration of the PeriLab simulation core with provided examples. Run the following commands in Julia:

```julia PeriLab
using PeriLab

PeriLab.get_examples()
PeriLab.main("examples/DCB/DCBmodel.yaml")
```
>Note: More details about the main functionalities in the yaml input deck [here](https://gitlab.com/dlr-perihub/PeriLab.jl/-/blob/main/src/Support/Parameters/parameter_handling.jl?ref_type=heads).

## Parallel Processing with `PeriLab` (MPI)

To handle large-scale problems efficiently, install [MPI](https://juliaparallel.org/MPI.jl/stable/usage/). Run PeriLab with two processors using the following commands:

```sh
$ julia
julia> using MPI
julia> MPI.install_mpiexecjl()
```

Run PeriLab with two processors:
```sh
$ mpiexecjl -n 2 julia -e "using PeriLab; PeriLab.main()" examples/DCB/DCBmodel.yaml -v
```

## Installing with Docker üê≥

 To install PeriLab using the official Perihub/Perilab Docker image, follow these steps:

1. **Install Docker**: Before you begin, ensure that you have Docker installed on your system. You can download and install Docker from the official website (https://www.docker.com/). Make sure your system meets the minimum requirements for running Docker.

2. **Pull the Perihub/Perilab Docker image**: Use the following command in a terminal or command prompt to pull the latest Perihub/Perilab Docker image from the Docker Hub repository:

   ```bash
   docker pull perihub/perilab
   ```

3. **Run the Docker container**: Once the image has been downloaded, create a new directory for your PeriLab simulations and navigate to it in the terminal or command prompt. Run the following command to start the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm -v <path_to_local_simulations_directory>:/app/simulations perihub/perilab bash
   ```

   Replace `<path_to_local_simulations_directory>` with the absolute path to a local directory where you want to store your PeriLab simulations. This command will open a new terminal session inside the Docker container.

Now, you've successfully installed PeriLab using the official Perihub/Perilab Docker image. You can start running your own peridynamic simulations within the container.

## `PeriLab` on `JuliaHub`

Experience the convenience of using PeriLab as a ready-to-use application on JuliaHub. Simply create an [account](https://juliahub.com), navigate to the [applications page](https://juliahub.com/ui/Applications), and add the repository URL: https://gitlab.com/dlr-perihub/PeriLab.jl.

Configure advanced options, such as _filename_, _dryrun_, _verbosity_, _debug_, and _silence_. Click __Start__ and monitor the job progress. Results will be available in a zipped folder.

Hit the __Start__ button and wait for the job to finish, the results will be available in a zipped folder.

>Note: The free tier on `JuliaHub` offers 20 hours of computational time per month.

## What's Next? üöÄ

Here are some exciting tasks on our roadmap:

- üîë **Quasi-static solver**: A future development for PeriLab is extending its capabilities with a more robust quasi-static solver for larger systems and complex boundary conditions.

- üëä **Contact**: An upcoming feature in PeriLab is enhancing contact modeling to support advanced features like friction, adhesion, and contact forces based on temperature or other variables.

- ‚ûï **More material and damage models**: PeriLab's future development plans include adding more sophisticated material models (e.g., viscoelastic-plastic) and damage models, expanding the software's applicability to a wider range of real-world phenomena.

- üë¨ **FEM/PD coupling**: A future enhancement for PeriLab is improving its FEM/PD coupling functionality by implementing more advanced techniques, such as a seamless data exchange between FEM and PD domains.

- ‚úÇÔ∏è **Distribution logic**: As part of its ongoing development, PeriLab will continue to incorporate new distribution logic for improved performance and reduced computational resources.

- üèéÔ∏è **Optimizations**: As part of its ongoing development, PeriLab will continue to focus on optimizing the simulation process by incorporating new techniques like parallel optimization algorithms for improved efficiency and reduced computational resources.
